class BruteForceElementarySteps(ElementaryStepGear):
    """
    This Gear probes Reactions by trying to react all Structures of each
    Compound with all Structures of each other Compound.
    For each Structure--Structure combination multiple arrangements (possible
    Elementary Steps) will be tested.

    This Gear does not consider Flasks/Complexes as reactive, they are not probed
    for elementary steps.

    Attributes
    ----------
    options :: BruteForceElementarySteps.Options
        The options for the BruteForceElementarySteps Gear.
    aggregate_filter :: scine_chemoton.gears.elementary_steps.aggregate_filters.AggregateFilter
        A filter for allowed reaction combinations, per default everything
        is permitted, no filter is applied.
    trial_generator :: TrialGenerator
        The generator to set up elementary step trial calculations by enumerating
        reactive complexes and trial reaction coordinates

    Notes
    -----
    This function assumes maximum spin when adding two Structures into one
    reactive complex.
    The need for elementary step guesses is tested by:

    a. for bimolecular reactions: checking whether there is already a
        calculation to search for a bimolecular reaction of the same
        structures with the same job order
    b. for unimolecular reactions: checking whether there is already a
        calculation to search for an intramolecular reaction of the same
        structure  with the same job order
