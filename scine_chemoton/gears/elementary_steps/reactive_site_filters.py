class ReactiveSiteFilter:
    """
    The base and default class for all reactive site filters. The default is to
    allow/pass all given checks.

    ReactiveSiteFilter are optional barriers in Chemoton that allow the user to
    cut down the exponential growth of the combinatorial explosion. The
    different sub-classes of this main ReactiveSiteFilter allow for a tailored
    choice of which parts of a molecule to deem reactive.

    The are some predefined filters that will be given in Chemoton, however,
    it should be simple to extend as needed even on a per-project basis.
    The key element when sub-classing this interface is to override the `filter`
    functions as defined here. When sub-classing please be aware that these
    filters are expected to be called often. Having each call do loops over
    entire collections is not wise.

    For the latter reason, user defined sub-classes are intended to be more
    complex, allowing for non-database stored/cached data across a run.
    This can be a significant speed up and allow for more intricate filtering.

    The different filter methods are applied in a subsequent matter, i.e.,
    only the atoms that pass the atom filter will be used to construct atom pairs,
    and only those of the atom pairs that pass the pair filter will be used to
    construct trial reaction coordinates in the TrialGenerators.

    NOTE: Eventhough there is the possibility to apply a filter to many sites/
    trial coordinates simultaneously there is no guarantee that all of them are
    passed to it at the same time.
