class CompoundFilter:
    """
    The base and default class for all filters. The default is to allow/pass all
    given checks.

    CompoundFilters are optional barriers in Chemoton that allow the user to cut down
    the exponential growth of the combinatorial explosion. The different
    sub-classes of this main CompoundFilter allow for a tailored choice of which
    additional branches of the network to allow.

    The are some predefined filters that will be given in Chemoton, however,
    it should be simple to extend as needed even on a per-project basis.
    The key element when sub-classing this interface is to override the `filter`
    functions as defined here. When sub-classing please be aware that these
    filters are expected to be called often. Having each call do loops over
    entire collections is not wise.

    For the latter reason, user defined sub-classes are intended to be more
    complex, allowing for non-database stored/cached data across a run.
    This can be a significant speed up and allow for more intricate filtering.
