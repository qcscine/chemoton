    This Gear is a basic scheduler for all calculations stored in the database.
    By default all Calculations generated by other Gears will be set to 'hold'
    upon creation.
    The scheduler will then, based on the given options, add them to the queue
    of Calculations run by the backend (Puffins).

    ----------
    options :: Scheduler.Options
        The options for the Scheduler Gear.

    Notes
    -----
    The logic counts the number of active Calculations per Order and compares
    with the allowed number of active Calculations.
    The gap between these numbers will be closed by activating Calculations
    that are currently on hold.
    The order of the execution of the jobs as well as their activation does not
    necessarily follow the chronological order of their generation.
