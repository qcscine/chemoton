class Engine:

    The Engine is a small class starting and stopping potentially infinitely
    running code acting on a reaction network in a database.
    All continuous jobs are called Gears (:class:`scine_chemoton.gears.Gears`), see
    the appropriate part of this documentation for existing examples.

    Parameters
    ----------
    credentials :: db.Credentials (Scine::Database::Credentials)
        The credentials to a database storing a reaction network.
        The started process will connect and interact with the referenced
        database.
    fork :: bool
        If true, this will cause the Engine to start the process defined by
        the given Gear with a fork, meaning it will run in a separate
        thread.

        ----------

        Parameters
        ----------
        single :: bool
            If true, runs only a single iteration of the Gear's loop.
            Default: false, meaning endless repetition of the loop.

        Raises
        ------
        AttributeError
